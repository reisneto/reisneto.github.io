Use <code>${workspaceFolder}</code> to get the absolute path of your project</p>\n<h3>settings.json</h3>\n<p>Don't ask me why, but when the config below is true our breakpoints don't work! so make sure it false. You can create a settings.json file inside .vscode folder or change it on your vs code settings.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"debug.javascript.usePreview\": false\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Don't use version vs code 1.47!</h3>\n<p>The whole idea of this post is this: I spent about 2 hours to figure out my vs code version was preventing me to use debugger. Breakpoints were not working because of it, even when I put <code>debug.javascript.usePreview</code> to false!</p>\n<p>Had to downgrade to <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46\">version 1.46</a> to make it work.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>special thanks to <a href=\"https://tjaddison.com/blog/2019/08/styling-markdown-tailwind-gatsby/\">this post</a> which helped me to styling my markdown -> html posts</p>\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/dynamic-routing/cover.jpg"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/debug-node-docker-vscode/cover.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
