This post is intended to help who already has some idea of these technologies and just need to adjust little things to make their projects works

## What we want
The whole idea was  
- to build the project in a safe and computer-free environment 
- guarantee code is tested and production ready
- send image to aws
- download image to run in a specific machine

Docker helped with first part
<put image of dockerfile here>

So far we have only lint test (for the sake of learning), but let's remember how crucial is to build tests.  
To automate lint test it was created a script called lint  
`"lint": "eslint --max-warnings 0 . && echo 'Lint OK'"`  
you can find it [here](https://github.com/reisneto/google-spreadsheet-api/blob/master/package.json#L6)  

## Script to run scripts inside docker container
Let's remember: we are coding using docker, so all tests must be done inside containers.  
To `make` my life easier I created a [makefile](https://github.com/reisneto/google-spreadsheet-api/blob/master/makefile) for that.  

example of lint command  
`docker-compose run --rm --no-deps app yarn lint`  
- `run`: runs a container
- `--rm`: remove container after it stops (so we don't end up our computer mememory space)
- `--no-deps`: if we have a database linked for example (or another service) it doesn't run together
- `app`: is the service name (as you can see [here](https://github.com/reisneto/google-spreadsheet-api/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
- `yarn lint`: there it is, lint command running inside the container.  

## Run Circle CI
To run it on circle ci I created a config.yml inside .circleci folder on the root of the project  
hope [this code](https://github.com/reisneto/google-spreadsheet-api/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) is self explanatory

From [this line](https://github.com/reisneto/google-spreadsheet-api/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L36) at circle ci config file we describe:  
- dockerfile from wich the image is going to be made
- path: where dockerfile is found
- profile-name: what is the aws profiile
- repo: repository name from aws Elastic Container Registry
- tag: tag (remember to change it whenever your'e uploading a new image, otherwise the image on aws which has the same tag will lost it.)

### AWS auth on Circle CI
Here I consider you know how to create a profile to upload images on ECR. You can check [Link](#links) section for help.
With a profile we need to set up some variables inside Circle CI

So go to your project settings --> environment variables and put these ones:  
![Circle CI - AWS variables](/assets/blog/using-circleci-to-upload-project-to-aws/circleci-aws-variables.png)

Aaand maybe all will be fine:
